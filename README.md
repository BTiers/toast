Toast Framework
===============

Toast Framework is a 2D easy-to-use C++ game framework inspired by FlashPunk. 

What's that?
--------------------------------------
If you already know AS3 and FlashPunk, Toast Framework is perfect
to make your projects run natively on Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Yep! 
Toast Framework is multi-platform and it could also be ported on iPhone.

It's perfect if you want to switch from AS3 to C++ in the painless way
possible.

It's perfect for learning C++ while doing what you love: making games.

It already has most of the features needed to complete a nice little game, but
you are encouraged to help and share your code with the others. 

Contribution
--------------------------------------
The code is thoroughly commented, but if you run into any problem, let me know! :)

In the spirit of open source software development, I always encourages community code contribution, so let's make a fork!
Just please let me know if you do something interesting with it.
